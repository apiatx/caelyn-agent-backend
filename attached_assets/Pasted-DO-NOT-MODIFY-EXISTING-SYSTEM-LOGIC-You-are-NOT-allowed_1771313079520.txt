DO NOT MODIFY EXISTING SYSTEM LOGIC

You are NOT allowed to refactor, restructure, or modify any existing codebase logic.

The ONLY permitted change is:

Replace the current Anthropic (Claude) API call used in the Orchestrator layer with an OpenAI API call.

Everything else must remain exactly the same.

Constraints

Do NOT modify:

Data fetching functions

API adapters (FMP, CMC, CoinGecko, etc.)

Grok sentiment module

Claude reasoning layer

Response schema

JSON output format

Frontend contracts

Environment variable structure (except adding OPENAI_API_KEY)

Tool definitions

Function signatures

The OpenAI model must only replace the orchestration decision engine.

The OpenAI call must:

Receive the same prompt currently sent to Claude orchestrator

Return tool selection decisions in the same schema format

Preserve existing parsing logic

Maintain deterministic structured output

Do NOT change:

Temperature (unless required for API compatibility)

Token limits

Error handling structure

The Claude Sonnet reasoning layer must remain untouched.

Required Implementation Change

Replace:

Anthropic client.messages.create(...)
(or equivalent Claude orchestration call)

With:

OpenAI client.responses.create(...)
Using GPT-4o or GPT-5 class model.

The output must match the current orchestration JSON schema exactly.

Output Format Requirements

The OpenAI orchestrator must output:

{
"apis_to_call": [],
"reasoning_priority": "",
"sentiment_required": true/false,
"notes": ""
}

Match current schema precisely.

No additional keys.
No formatting changes.
No structural edits.

Environment Changes

Add:

OPENAI_API_KEY to secrets.

Do NOT remove ANTHROPIC_API_KEY because Claude is still used as reasoning layer.

Final Condition

If any change impacts:

Claude reasoning

Grok sentiment

Data adapters

Frontend rendering

Response formatting

The change must be rejected.

Only the orchestration LLM provider changes.

Nothing else.

🔧 Why This Works

Because you are isolating:

Orchestration = control brain
Reasoning = critique brain

That’s professional architecture.

🧠 Bonus: Model Recommendation

Use:

gpt-4o for speed
or
gpt-5 (if available to you) for stronger planning

Keep temperature low for orchestration:
0.1 – 0.2

Planner should be deterministic.

⚠️ Important

Do NOT let Replit AI:

“Improve” the code

Refactor to OpenAI Agents SDK

Add streaming changes

Modify schema

Consolidate modules

It will try.

Don’t let it.

This is a surgical swap.
