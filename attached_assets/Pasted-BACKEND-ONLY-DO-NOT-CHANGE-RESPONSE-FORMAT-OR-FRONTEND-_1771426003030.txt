BACKEND ONLY — DO NOT CHANGE RESPONSE FORMAT OR FRONTEND

Goal:
In daily_briefing (and any other briefing-style responses that populate `signal_highlights`), never return N/A for:
- signal_highlights.best_ta_setup
- signal_highlights.biggest_volume

Keep the output structure EXACTLY the same as today (same keys, same display_type, same formatting). Only change selection logic.

1) Fix best_ta_setup fallback
Current behavior returns N/A when strict criteria is not met.

Change:
- Always select the best available TA candidate even if it does not hit the strict “breakout” threshold.
- Implement a fallback ladder:

Step A (strict): choose top candidate where:
  - technical_score >= 70 OR stage2_breakout == true OR (macd_crossover && near_52w_high)
Step B (fallback): if none match Step A, choose highest technical_score among candidates with:
  - technical_score >= 60
Step C (final fallback): if still none, choose highest technical_score overall (as long as there is at least 1 candidate)

Output:
- Always populate:
  signal_highlights.best_ta_setup = { "ticker": "<symbol>", "signal": "<short reason>" }
- The "signal" string should explain the best available setup based on what exists (examples):
  - "Near breakout + improving momentum (RSI rising, MACD improving)"
  - "Strong trend (price > key MAs) despite low breakout count"
  - "Best relative strength in scan (no clean breakouts today)"

Important:
- Do NOT output "N/A" if candidates exist.
- Only output N/A if there are literally zero equity candidates.

2) Redefine biggest_volume to “biggest volume % increase”
Current behavior appears to rely on absolute volume or missing volume.

Change:
- Compute volume_pct_increase for each candidate when possible:
  volume_pct_increase = ((today_volume / avg_volume_30d) - 1) * 100
- If intraday volume is not available, use the best available proxy you already have:
  - If you have relative_volume / rvol: convert to % increase: (rvol - 1) * 100
  - If you have volume vs avgVolume fields from any provider, use those.

Selection:
- Choose the candidate with the highest volume_pct_increase, minimum threshold:
  - Require today_volume and avg_volume_30d (or rvol) to be present
  - volume_pct_increase must be > 0
Fallback:
- If no candidate has sufficient data, do NOT return N/A if there are candidates with any volume signal.
  - Fall back to highest available rvol
  - Or highest available raw volume only if NOTHING else exists
- Only return N/A if volume data is missing for all candidates.

Output:
- Keep the existing key:
  signal_highlights.biggest_volume = { "ticker": "<symbol>", "signal": "<short string>" }
- The signal string must explicitly reference % increase:
  - "Volume +185% vs 30D avg (2.85x)"
  - "RVOL 3.2x (approx +220% vs avg)"

3) Add a tiny debug log (backend only)
Add one log line (no schema change):
- [HIGHLIGHTS] best_ta=<ticker> biggest_vol=<ticker> vol_pct=<value or NA> ta_score=<value>

4) Test cases (run locally)
- Run daily_briefing twice (to test cache) and confirm:
  - best_ta_setup is never N/A when there are candidates
  - biggest_volume is never N/A when any volume/rvol exists
  - biggest_volume signal uses % increase wording

Publish instruction:
After tests pass, publish the FastAPI backend (the public URL project).
