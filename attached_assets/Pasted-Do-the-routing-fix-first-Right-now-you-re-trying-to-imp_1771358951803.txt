Do the routing fix first.

Right now you’re trying to improve the quality of a system that still doesn’t know what it’s supposed to fetch.

That’s backwards.

What’s Actually Happening

Your current response:

“AI/semis ahead of NVDA earnings… small-cap momentum explodes…”

That’s not a reasoning failure.

That’s a data starvation failure.

Claude can’t give you:

tickers

catalysts

thesis

sector-relative setups

if it wasn’t given structured candidates.

When it only gets high-level summaries or fragmented cross-market context, it defaults to macro narrative commentary.

That’s exactly what you’re seeing.

The Order Matters
Step 1 → Fix orchestration (intent-driven)

Make sure:

“Trending now” triggers cross-asset scan

It explicitly selects modules

It gathers structured candidates (stocks, crypto, commodities)

It pulls FA + TA + catalyst data

It builds a dataset before Claude writes

If this isn’t correct, improving Claude output is cosmetic.

Step 2 → Enforce structured output requirements

Once orchestration works, then enforce:

Every “trending” response MUST include:

Ticker

Asset class

Catalyst (verified)

Technical state

Risk level

Thesis

Why now

What invalidates

Without structured candidate inputs, Claude cannot satisfy that.

Why It’s Currently Weak

Your current flow likely does:

“Trending” → classification
→ maybe pulls social + high-level dashboard
→ Claude writes summary

It does NOT:

Generate ranked candidate list first

Score them

Pass structured dataset

Then ask Claude to synthesize

So Claude writes like a strategist, not like a trader.

If You Fix Quality First…

You’ll be layering rules on top of a routing flaw.

Then once you switch to intent orchestration,
everything breaks again.

Do the foundation first.

Correct Sequence

Implement intent-driven OpenAI orchestration

Confirm cross-asset module activation

Confirm structured candidate dataset is passed to Claude

Then enforce mandatory structured output format

Then refine microcap vs institutional modes

Quick Diagnostic

Before changing anything:

Ask your system:

“List the exact tickers you evaluated before producing this answer.”

If it can’t respond with a structured evaluated list,
your orchestration layer is not working correctly.

That’s the core issue.

Final Answer

Do the orchestration refactor first.

Then fix response structure.

Then refine scoring.

You’re trying to tune the engine while the steering wheel isn’t connected yet.

Fix steering first.
