The Real Problem (Again)

Your output screams one thing:

Your system is overweighting crypto-specific scanners + social velocity.

It is not doing:

Cross-asset normalization

Sector-relative strength comparison

Liquidity tier enforcement

Catalyst verification scoring

Risk regime penalty enforcement

The model is doing what you implicitly allowed it to do.

It is behaving like:
“Find high-signal assets in the data you fed me.”

If crypto data is richer + louder,
crypto wins.

🎯 Why It Returned Junk

Because:

Crypto scanners generate more “signals”

Social chatter is heavier in crypto

Funding data creates extreme outlier signals

Microcaps show bigger % moves

Your ranking system likely rewards signal count

Stocks rarely produce:

1,161% annualized funding anomalies

50% breakouts in a day

CoinGecko trending rank

So they get suppressed.

This is math bias, not model bias.

🔥 Would “Leaning on Sonnet 4 More” Help?

No.

The model is already reasoning correctly based on inputs.

If the inputs are biased,
the outputs will be biased.

Changing model version = cosmetic change.

🧠 Here’s The Actual Diagnostic Question

When you ran:

“Trending across all markets”

Did your orchestrator:

A) Pull stock APIs
B) Pull commodities
C) Pull crypto
D) Pull all three

If it classified it as crypto-heavy,
then the flaw is in classification.

If it pulled all three,
but only crypto made final ranking,
then flaw is in scoring.

🧱 What You Need Instead Of Model Change

You need structural guardrails like:

1️⃣ Cross-Asset Normalization

Each asset class must be scored independently first.

Then normalized.

Then ranked.

Right now crypto probably floods the ranking.

2️⃣ Market Cap Floor

Kill sub-$250M assets automatically.

Institutional filter.

Instant improvement.

3️⃣ Liquidity Minimum

Require real 24h volume threshold.

4️⃣ Multi-Factor Minimum

Require:

Social momentum

Technical confirmation

Verified catalyst

Sector alignment

Liquidity strength

Minimum 3/5.

5️⃣ Macro Regime Penalty

If macro = risk-off,
penalize speculative small caps.

Your output literally said risk-off,
then recommended microcap alts.

That’s inconsistent weighting.

📊 Would GPT-5 Fix This?

No.

Claude 4.5, GPT-5, Gemini Ultra —
they’ll all produce similar answers
if you feed them the same biased signal mix.

🧠 Important: You’re Close

Your architecture is solid.

Your compression is solid.

Your waterfall is solid.

Your cost discipline is solid.

Your weakness is:

Ranking logic discipline.
