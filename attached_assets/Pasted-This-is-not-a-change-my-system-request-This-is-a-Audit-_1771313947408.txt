This is not a “change my system” request.

This is a:

Audit the architecture. Confirm cost discipline. Do not touch anything.

You want Replit to:

Verify you are not dumping raw JSON into high-tier models

Verify you are not using expensive models for extraction

Verify prompt caching or instruction reuse is handled intelligently

Confirm waterfall architecture exists

Make ZERO behavioral changes

Good. That’s a surgical audit request.

Below is the exact instruction block you should paste into Replit.

🔒 REPLIT INSTRUCTION – ARCHITECTURE AUDIT ONLY

You are performing a non-invasive audit of the existing AI agent architecture.

You are NOT allowed to:

Refactor any code

Modify prompts

Change workflows

Change model assignments

Update token limits

Change reasoning logic

Alter orchestration

Modify API integrations

Improve formatting

Touch any Claude prompts

Touch any OpenAI prompts

Touch Grok logic

This is strictly a verification pass.

OBJECTIVE

Verify whether the system currently follows a cost-efficient waterfall architecture consistent with the following principles:

1. JSON Bloat Prevention

Check whether:

Raw JSON responses from financial APIs (FMP, CMC, CoinGecko, etc.) are passed directly into high-tier reasoning models (Claude Sonnet / Opus or GPT flagship models).

If raw JSON is being passed directly:
Flag it.

If condensed/parsed data is passed instead:
Confirm it.

Do NOT modify anything.

2. Model Role Separation

Verify whether the system uses:

A lightweight model for extraction / parsing (if applicable)

A higher-tier model only for reasoning

If the same expensive model is used for:

Raw JSON parsing

Cleaning

Metric extraction

Flag it.

Do NOT change it.

3. Prompt Caching / Instruction Reuse

Verify whether:

System prompts are reused efficiently

Large static instruction blocks are resent every request unnecessarily

If instructions are re-sent fully each time:
Flag it.

Do NOT optimize.

4. Waterfall Architecture Check

Determine whether the architecture currently resembles:

User Prompt
→ Orchestrator
→ Data Fetch
→ Extraction / Condensing
→ Sentiment
→ Reasoning Layer

Or whether it resembles:

User Prompt
→ Fetch Massive JSON
→ Dump everything into reasoning model

Report which pattern exists.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a structured audit summary:

{
"json_bloat_risk": "low | medium | high",
"model_role_separation": "correct | mixed | inefficient",
"prompt_caching_efficiency": "efficient | redundant",
"waterfall_architecture": "present | partial | absent",
"cost_risk_assessment": "low | moderate | high",
"notes": ""
}

Do not recommend changes.
Do not modify any files.
Do not rewrite any prompts.

This is strictly a verification report.

🧠 Why This Is Important

You’re protecting:

Your existing logic

Your tested reasoning prompts

Your workflow integrity

Your performance stability

You are asking for confirmation, not intervention.

That’s exactly right.

⚠️ Reality Check For You

Gemini’s advice is directionally correct.

The biggest silent killer in financial agents is:

Dumping 40KB JSON blobs into a flagship model.

If you are already condensing data before reasoning,
you’re fine.

If you are not,
cost will scale badly with traffic.

But you don’t want Replit “optimizing” anything yet.

You want clarity first.
