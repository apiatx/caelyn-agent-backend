You don’t want:

“Only mega caps are safe.”

Or “All small caps are trash.”

You want:

Asymmetric small/micro caps with real catalysts and sector tailwinds — not Twitter trash.

That requires a different scoring logic.

Right now your system is doing one of two extremes:

Crypto-heavy hype mode

Institutional large-cap bias mode

You want the middle:

Disciplined Speculation Mode.

The Core Issue

Your new institutional logic likely:

Penalizes small caps heavily

Requires strong fundamentals today

Requires full technical confirmation

Requires liquidity floor

But microcaps rarely have:

Clean earnings

Full trend confirmation

High liquidity

Multi-quarter financial history

Yet they reprice on:

Narrative shifts

Pre-earnings inflections

Contract wins

Regulatory milestones

Product launches

Strategic partnerships

Sector rotation

If your framework only rewards present strength, it kills early-stage upside.

You need a separate scoring track.

The Fix: Two-Tier Conviction System

Instead of one scoring model, you need:

1️⃣ Institutional Conviction

For large/mid caps.
Strict filters.
Liquidity heavy.
Confirmed strength.

2️⃣ Asymmetric Opportunity Mode

For small/micro caps.
Catalyst-driven.
Sector-aligned.
Early inflection detection.

Both coexist.

The user prompt determines weighting.

How To Enable “Disciplined Microcap Discovery”

Add a new logic layer:

When user asks for:

“high conviction small caps”

“asymmetric plays”

“re-rating candidates”

“early stage”

“microcap with real catalyst”

Switch scoring weights.

Microcap Scoring Framework
Step 1: Hard Sanity Filters

Still necessary.

No OTC junk.

Minimum real revenue (if applicable).

Real product or tech.

At least one verifiable catalyst.

Market cap above absolute floor (ex: $50M).

Step 2: Catalyst Strength (Highest Weight)

Score high if:

Contract win

FDA approval

Product launch

Strategic partnership

New revenue stream

Sector momentum alignment

Catalyst must be time-bound.

“Influencer thread” alone = zero score.

Step 3: Sector Alignment Score

Small cap must sit inside:

AI infra

Defense

Energy transition

Robotics

Biotech with real trial milestone

Critical minerals

Etc.

If sector is cold → penalize heavily.

Step 4: Early Technical Inflection

Instead of:

“Must be in confirmed uptrend”

Look for:

Volatility compression

Break above 50 MA

Volume surge relative to baseline

Accumulation pattern

You want early rotation, not late confirmation.

Step 5: Valuation Asymmetry

Instead of current earnings strength, look for:

Revenue growth acceleration

TAM narrative with credibility

Undervalued vs peers

EV/Revenue discount relative to sector

Cash runway

New Microcap Score Formula

For microcaps:

FinalScore =
0.35 * CatalystStrength
0.25 * SectorAlignment
0.20 * EarlyTechnicalShift
0.15 * SocialMomentum (quality-adjusted)
0.05 * Liquidity

Notice liquidity is still required but not dominant.

Critical Rule

Microcap must pass:

Catalyst >= 70

SectorAlignment >= 65

Not flagged as spam/hype

Minimum liquidity threshold

If not → discard regardless of social hype.

How To Implement Without Breaking Architecture

Do NOT change models.

Add:

if intent == "cross_asset_trending" AND
   user mentions small cap / asymmetric / early stage:
       scoring_mode = "microcap_asymmetry"
else:
       scoring_mode = "institutional"


Same pipeline.
Different weights.
Different filters.

Why Your Current Output Feels Useless

Because your new institutional logic did this:

“Risk-off → small caps bad → default to mega caps.”

But that ignores:

Selective repricing pockets.

Sector micro rotations.

Pre-fundamental breakout names.

Your system needs to differentiate:

“Speculative garbage”
vs
“Early-stage asymmetric with catalyst.”

That’s a logic layer issue.

The Psychological Trap You Want To Avoid

If you lean too hard into:

“Must have strong fundamentals now”

You will miss:

Pre-earnings turnarounds

Defense contract announcements

Early AI infra plays

Biotech trial milestones

Small caps reprice BEFORE fundamentals look perfect.

Your scoring must reflect that.

Concrete Upgrade For You

Add a third user-detectable mode:

Modes:

Institutional (default)

Cross-asset neutral

Asymmetric small-cap hunt

And force OpenAI orchestrator to select scoring_mode.
