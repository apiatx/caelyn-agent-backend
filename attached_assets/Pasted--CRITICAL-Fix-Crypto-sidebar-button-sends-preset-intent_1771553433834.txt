## CRITICAL Fix: "Crypto" sidebar button sends preset_intent "crypto_focus" which doesn't resolve

### Root Cause (CONFIRMED)
The frontend sends `preset_intent: "crypto_focus"` when the user clicks "Crypto" in the sidebar. But the backend's PRESET_ALIASES map only has `"crypto": "crypto_scanner"`. The preset `"crypto_focus"` is not in the map, so `_resolve_preset()` returns None, the preset routing fails, and the query falls through to the OpenAI classifier which incorrectly routes it to the trending/cross_market pipeline. That's why the response shows stocks (KNRX, KLAR, AGAE) instead of crypto.

### Fix: Add "crypto_focus" to PRESET_ALIASES

In `claude_agent.py`, find PRESET_ALIASES (around line 30-70). Add this line:
```python
    "crypto_focus": "crypto_scanner",
```

That's it. One line. This maps the frontend's preset name to the correct backend pipeline.

### But also: Check for other missing preset aliases

The frontend might send other preset names that don't resolve. Check all the sidebar items and their preset_intent values. Common patterns that might be missing:
```python
    # Add these if they don't already exist:
    "crypto_focus": "crypto_scanner",
    "crypto_scan": "crypto_scanner", 
    "commodity_focus": "commodity_scan",
    "commodity_scan": "commodity_scan",
    "energy_focus": "thematic_scan",
    "ai_compute": "thematic_scan",
    "quantum_focus": "thematic_scan",
    "materials_focus": "thematic_scan",
    "aerospace_focus": "thematic_scan",
    "tech_focus": "thematic_scan",
    "finance_focus": "thematic_scan",
    "healthcare_focus": "thematic_scan",
    "real_estate_focus": "thematic_scan",
```

Check the server logs for any "[ROUTING] Unknown preset_intent" messages — those reveal which frontend presets don't have backend mappings.

Also run this to find ALL preset values the frontend might send:
```bash
grep -rn "preset_intent\|preset.*focus\|preset.*scan" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.js" frontend/ src/ client/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | head -30
```

### Testing
1. Click "Crypto" in sidebar
2. Check logs: should show `[ROUTING] Resolved preset alias 'crypto_focus' → 'crypto_scanner'`
3. Response should show crypto data (BTC, ETH, altcoins) — NOT stocks
4. Click other sidebar items (Energy, AI/Compute, etc.) and verify they don't return "Unknown preset_intent" errors
5. All other presets (Daily Briefing, Trending Now, Best Trades) still work
6. `python -m pytest` passes
