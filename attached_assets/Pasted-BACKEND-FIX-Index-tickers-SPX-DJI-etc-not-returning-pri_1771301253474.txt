BACKEND FIX: Index tickers (SPX, DJI, etc.) not returning price data

Index tickers like SPX, DJI, IXIC, NDX, RUT, VIX, DXY are not returning prices because they aren't stocks — Yahoo Finance and FMP don't return quotes for raw index symbols.

In the /api/portfolio/quotes endpoint, add index ticker handling. When asset_type is "index", route these tickers to Yahoo Finance using the correct Yahoo index symbols:

Add an INDEX_YAHOO_SYMBOLS mapping:

INDEX_YAHOO_SYMBOLS = {
    "SPX": "^GSPC",
    "SPY": "SPY",
    "DJI": "^DJI",
    "IXIC": "^IXIC",
    "NDX": "^NDX",
    "QQQ": "QQQ",
    "RUT": "^RUT",
    "VIX": "^VIX",
    "DXY": "DX-Y.NYB",
}

When processing tickers, separate index tickers just like crypto and commodity tickers are separated. For each index ticker:

1. Look up the Yahoo symbol from INDEX_YAHOO_SYMBOLS
2. Fetch the quote from Yahoo using the mapped symbol (e.g., fetch "^GSPC" instead of "SPX")
3. Store the result in quotes under the ORIGINAL ticker (e.g., quotes["SPX"] not quotes["^GSPC"])
4. Set sector to "Index" and asset_type to "index"

Add index_tickers to the routing logic alongside stock_tickers, crypto_tickers, and commodity_tickers:

index_tickers = [t for t in tickers if asset_types.get(t) == "index"]
stock_tickers = [t for t in tickers if asset_types.get(t, "stock") in ("stock", "etf") and t not in index_tickers]

Then after the commodity section, add:

# ---- Indices: use Yahoo index symbols ----
if index_tickers:
    for ticker in index_tickers:
        yahoo_symbol = INDEX_YAHOO_SYMBOLS.get(ticker)
        if yahoo_symbol:
            try:
                # Use whatever Yahoo fetch method the rest of the code uses
                # This should match how stock_tickers are fetched via Yahoo
                # but using the mapped symbol (e.g., "^GSPC" instead of "SPX")
                # Store result under the original ticker name
                # After fetching, set:
                # quotes[ticker]["sector"] = "Index"
                # quotes[ticker]["asset_type"] = "index"
                pass  # Replace this with the actual Yahoo fetch call matching your existing pattern
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"[PORTFOLIO] Index {ticker} ({yahoo_symbol}) error: {e}")
        else:
            print(f"[PORTFOLIO] No Yahoo symbol mapping for index: {ticker}")

IMPORTANT: Look at how stock_tickers are currently fetched via Yahoo in this endpoint and use the exact same method/function for index tickers — just pass the mapped Yahoo symbol instead of the raw ticker. The fetch pattern should be identical, only the symbol changes.
