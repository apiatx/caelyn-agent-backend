BACKEND FIX: Restructure portfolio quote fetching with proper API fallback chain

The portfolio quotes are failing because we're over-relying on CoinGecko (rate limited) and FMP (rate limited) when we have better options available. Here are ALL the API keys available — add them to the environment/config if not already present:

FINNHUB_API_KEY (already in config)
POLYGON_API_KEY (already in config) 
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY (needs to be added if not present)

=== CHANGE 1: Use Finnhub as PRIMARY source for stock quotes + profiles ===

Finnhub has 60 calls/min on free tier and returns quote + profile in separate endpoints. For the portfolio, use Finnhub instead of Yahoo for stocks.

For stock quotes, use Finnhub's quote endpoint:
GET https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol={ticker}&token={FINNHUB_API_KEY}
Returns: { c: currentPrice, d: change, dp: percentChange, h: high, l: low, o: open, pc: previousClose }

For stock profiles (sector, market cap, industry, company name), use:
GET https://finnhub.io/api/v1/stock/profile2?symbol={ticker}&token={FINNHUB_API_KEY}
Returns: { name, sector (called "finnhubIndustry"), marketCapitalization, logo, industry (called "finnhubIndustry"), ... }

NOTE: Finnhub calls the sector field "finnhubIndustry". Map it to "sector" in the quote response.

Update the stock quote fetching logic:
1. Try Finnhub first for ALL stock tickers
2. For each stock, make TWO Finnhub calls: /quote for price + /stock/profile2 for sector/marketCap
3. Can batch these concurrently (Promise.all for both calls per ticker)
4. If Finnhub fails (429 or error), fall back to Yahoo
5. If Yahoo also fails, fall back to FMP as last resort

Cache Finnhub profile data for 24 hours (sector/marketCap don't change).
Cache Finnhub quotes for 60 seconds.

=== CHANGE 2: Add CoinMarketCap as crypto fallback ===

When CoinGecko returns 429, fall back to CoinMarketCap instead of Yahoo (which returns wrong tokens).

CoinMarketCap quote endpoint:
GET https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest?symbol={symbols}&CMC_PRO_API_KEY={key}
Header: X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY: {COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY}

This accepts comma-separated symbols: symbol=BTC,ETH,HYPE,SOL

Returns price, market_cap, volume_24h, percent_change_24h for each.

Update the crypto quote fetching logic:
1. Try CoinGecko first (batch all crypto in one call)
2. If CoinGecko returns 429, try CoinMarketCap as fallback
3. CoinMarketCap accepts symbols directly (no need for ID mapping like CoinGecko)
4. Map the CMC response fields to match the existing quote format:
   - quote.USD.price → price
   - quote.USD.percent_change_24h → change_pct
   - quote.USD.volume_24h → volume
   - quote.USD.market_cap → market_cap
   - Set sector to "Crypto"

=== CHANGE 3: Reduce CoinGecko background service usage ===

The background real-time price service hammers CoinGecko. Since we now have CoinMarketCap as fallback, reduce the background CoinGecko polling to once every 120 seconds instead of every 5-60 seconds. This leaves more rate limit headroom for portfolio requests.

=== CHANGE 4: Stop using FMP for profile enrichment ===

Remove or disable the FMP /stable/profile call for stock sector/marketCap. Finnhub /stock/profile2 now handles this and has a much higher rate limit (60/min vs FMP's ~250/day). Save FMP's daily budget for the AI screener which actually needs it.

=== SUMMARY OF API ROUTING ===

Portfolio quotes endpoint should now route like this:

STOCKS:
  Quote: Finnhub /quote → Yahoo fallback → FMP fallback
  Profile: Finnhub /stock/profile2 (cached 24h) → FMP /stable/profile fallback

CRYPTO:
  CoinGecko /simple/price (batch) → CoinMarketCap /quotes/latest fallback
  Skip Yahoo for crypto entirely (returns wrong tokens)

COMMODITIES:
  Yahoo futures symbols (already working)

INDICES:
  Yahoo index symbols (already working, ^GSPC, ^DJI etc)
