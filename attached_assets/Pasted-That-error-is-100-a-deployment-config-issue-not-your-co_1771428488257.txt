That error is 100% a deployment config issue, not your code.

Replit’s deploy runtime expects your server to bind to a real port, and it exposes that port via the $PORT environment variable. Your run command currently has --port with nothing after it, so Uvicorn crash-loops.

Fix (Backend project only)
What your run command must look like

Use exactly this pattern:

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT


If your FastAPI app lives in a different file/module, swap main:app accordingly (examples below).

Where to change it in Replit
Option A (most common): .replit file

Open the backend Replit project

Find the .replit file

Set:

run = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"

Option B: replit.toml

If your project uses replit.toml, look for the run command and set it to the same thing:

run = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"

Option C: Deployments “Run command” field

If you’re using Replit Deployments:

Deployments → your deployment → Settings → Run command

Paste:

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

If your app is not main.py

Use the correct import path:

app.py with app = FastAPI():

uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT


src/main.py:

uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT


If your variable is named api instead of app:

uvicorn main:api --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Exact prompt to paste to your BACKEND Replit agent

Copy/paste this:

BACKEND DEPLOY FIX ONLY.

Deployment is failing because the run command has `--port` with no value. Update the Replit run command to bind to the injected $PORT.

Set run command to:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

If the FastAPI app is not in main.py or the variable isn't named app, detect the correct module:function (e.g., app:app, src.main:app) and set it accordingly.

After changing, restart and confirm logs show Uvicorn listening on 0.0.0.0:<PORT> and /ping returns 200.
Do not change any application logic.

Quick sanity check after you change it

In logs you should see something like:

“Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:XXXXX”

Hit:

/ping

/health
